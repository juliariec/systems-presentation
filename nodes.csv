7,4,Social Connectedness,"from [Ang](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040260818301874): 

> Social connectedness is a general term broadly encompassing the quantity, quality, frequency, type and network structure of one's relationships with friends, family, and the community. Being socially connected depends on one's relationships with close friends and family, as well as broader aspects of social life such as participation in social activities organized by clubs and associations.

From [Toepoel](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23874058/):

- Social connectedness is difficult to measure — quantity and quality are both important aspects
    - **Objective measures:** number of social gatherings, number of close contacts
    - **Subjective measures:** satisfaction with social contacts, feelings of isolation or loneliness
- The concept has circular logic: it leads to positive outcomes (e.g. participation in group activities) and is also a result of those same outcomes
- Determining the mechanisms that cause the 'virtuous circle' can be unclear",0

[View source](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11879243/3798618.pdf)

According to Coleman and Putnam, **social capital** refers to features of a social structure that facilitate actions of people in the structure. 

In the **social cohesion** definition, social capital is understood in terms of the structure as a whole, whereas in the **network theory** it's framed on an individual level. 

Social capital can also be subdivided into four kinds: 

1. **Structural:** observable characteristics like social organization or civic engagement
2. **Cognitive:** someone's subjective perception of characteristics like trust and reciprocity
3. **Bonding:** relationships between members of the social structure with shared characteristics
4. **Bridging:** connections between individuals with different amounts of power

### Relationship to social connectedness

From Kawachi and Berkman:

> A useful distinction can be drawn here between social capital and social networks. Social networks are a characteristic that can (and most often has been) be measured at the individual level, whereas social capital should be properly considered a feature of the collective (neighborhood, community, society) to which the individual belongs. It makes no sense to measure an individual's social capital. In theory, a well-connected individual (one who has lots of friends and close relatives) could experience different life chances and health outcomes depending on whether he or she resides in an environment that is rich or poor in social capital. (176-177)

An individual's social connectedness may contribute to a social structure's bonding social capital.

### Relationship to health

There have been studies investigating the relationship between social capital and health. One study ([Social Cohesion, Social Capital, and Health](https://oxfordmedicine.com/view/10.1093/med/9780195377903.001.0001/med-9780195377903-chapter-8) by Kawachi and Berkman) suggested four ways that social capital can influence health:

1. Diffusion of knowledge on health promotion
2. Maintenance of healthy behavioral norms through informal social control
3. Promotion of access to local services and amenities
4. Psychological processes that provide affective support and mutual respect

A relationship between social capital and health could be causal, but it could go either way (having social capital improves health outcomes **or** being healthy increases social capital).

Using a study that asked questions relating to bonding, bridging, and linking social capital and self-rated health and life satisfaction, Elgar et al. found that social capital's health benefits for individuals are stronger in countries with more social capital.

### Relationship to social connectedness

[View source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20668659/)

The two main theoretical models for how social relationships influence health are the **stress buffering model** and the **main effects model**.

In the stress buffering model, social relationships are thought to provide resources that improve responses to stress and therefore buffer their effects on health.

The main effects model suggests that social relationships are associated with other influences that improve health, such as following norms for healthy behaviours.

[View source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3786751/)

Studies in social genomics can reveal certain gene programs that are sensitive to social conditions, but may not explain *why* they evolved that way. For example, it's been shown that when faced with socially adverse circumstances, the human body shifts resources from antiviral to inflammatory defenses. One explanation for this is that in hunter-gatherer conditions, a robust social life meant an increased vulnerability to diseases transmitted through social contact (like viral infections), but being isolated decreased that risk and instead increased the likelihood of wound-mediated bacterial infection.",3

A study of 18 villages in a northern Ecuadorian province conducted by Zelner et al. found that villages with high degrees of connectivity have lower risk of diarrheal disease and fever.

This meta-analytic review extracted data from 148 studies and found that individuals with adequate social relationships have a 50% greater likelihood of survival (an odds ratio (OR) of 1.5) than those with insufficient relationships — comparable with quitting smoking. Social relationships are more predictive of mortality risk when complex measures of social integration are used (OR=1.91) rather than a simple structural measure such as marital status (OR=1.33).",7

- Surveyed ~5900 Dutch participants about their participation in 10 different leisure categories

[View source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040260818301874)

This paper sets out to investigate the question: are changes in Americans' social connectedness a consequence of the change in population age composition or of cohort changes? 

Since social disengagement or isolation is considered more common among older people, many studies focus on their social connectedness; however, it is also necessary to study younger populations so that comparisons can be made.

Focusing on the ""social participation"" measure of social connectedness, Ang finds that informal social participation decreases with age, but formal social participation increases, which contradicts the idea that older adults socially disengage entirely. He also finds that informal social participation remains stable across cohorts.",14

5.5,3.5,Urban Design,"### Social Capital and the Built Environment: The Importance of Walkable Neighborhoods

[View source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1448008/)

Leyden surveyed 279 households in Galway, Ireland to investigate the relationship between neighbourhood and social capital. He assessed social capital by asking how well respondents knew their neighbours and how socially engaged they were and by using a Political Participation Index and a Trust Index. Neighbourhood walkability was the only measure that had a statistically significant effect on all four of these measures of social capital, and it was the most important predictor of the Trust Index. It seems that a correlation between the two concepts exists, but the study used a small sample size and cannot assert that neighbourhood walkability causes social engagement and not vice versa (that socially engaged people choose to live in more walkable neighbourhoods).
